**Ex1 Main Program**
This program demonstrates operations on numbers represented as strings in different bases (from base 2 to base 16). It validates the input, converts it to integers,
performs calculations (addition and multiplication), and outputs the results in a user-defined base. Additionally, it identifies the maximum value among the input numbers
and the results.
